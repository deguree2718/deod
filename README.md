# Download Emotes on Discord

A simple bot, if anyone needs I can keep adding more stuff into it, so far it has four functions

ps: I still did not manage to dockerize the bot, if anyone's got any tips I'd very much appreciate it
(meaning I won't be running the bot frequently)

## RNG
!roll
- generates a number from 1 through 20

!roll [number]
- generates a number from 1 through [number]

## Download Emote
!download :customEmote\:
- gets the emote id and return the png or gif that originated the emote

## Download and Create Emote

!downloadCreate :customEmote\:
- does the same as !download but it replicates the emote into the current server

## Steal Emote in stealth mode

!propertyIsTheft :customEmote\:
- replicates the emote into the current server
