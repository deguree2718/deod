# Download Emotes on Discord

A simple bot, if anyone needs I can keep adding more stuff into it, so far it has four functions

ps: Managed to dockerize it, now all I gotta find is somewhere to host it and it'll be up and running

## RNG
$roll
- generates a number from 1 through 20

$roll [number]
- generates a number from 1 through [number]

## Download Emote
$download :customEmote\:
- gets the emote id and return the png or gif that originated the emote

## Download and Create Emote

4downloadCreate :customEmote\:
- does the same as !download but it replicates the emote into the current server

## Steal Emote in stealth mode

$propertyIsTheft :customEmote\:
- replicates the emote into the current server

## --help

$help
- Shows the command list for the bot
