# Download Emotes on Discord

A simple bot, if anyone needs I can keep adding more stuff into it, so far it has two functions

## RNG
!roll
- generates a number from 1 through 20

!roll [number]
- generates a number from 1 through [number]

# Download Emote
!download :customEmote\:
- gets the emote id and return the png or gif that originated the emote
